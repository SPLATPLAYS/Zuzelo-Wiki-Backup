        <h1>Discord</h1>
        <p>Learn more about the amazing server : "Penguin's Dungeon"</p>
    </header>
  	<div class = "container">
      <h2>Eras</h2>
      <p>Since it's beginning Penguin's Dungeon has passed many different periods, characterized by different users and activity</p>
      <div class = "container">
      <h3>The Beginning Era</h3>
        <p>Not much is known since only a few people were active during this time. Zuzelo, the owner, Radnnugget, and Boris Borisov as well as Lasse were the only active, though this activity was very little. </p>
        <h3> The Structure Era </h3>
          <p> The server started to take shape but with it also came some problematic personnalities. To solve those problems Zuzelo named Radnugget mod. Very little discussion was happening and there were only 3 or 4 active persons.
This era was before Zuzelo's channel hit 10 000 subscribers and the server was only at it's beginning.
          </p>
        <h3>The Golden Trio Era </h3>
        <p>To celebrate (and just before) hitting 10 000 subscribers, Zuzelo did a promotion of the discord server in one of his videos, giving a special role (From Ze Start) to anyone here before 10K subs. This brought a lot of members to the server. However Zuzelo, Radnugget, and Boris Borisov talked way less than in the beginning Era and there were only about 6 or 7 active members that talked and participated in contest. Almost all of the discussions were between the Golden Trio of Lasse, Slipte, and Seldon, a new member.</p>
        <p>Its important to note that SPLATPLAYS joined in this era but was barely active for the coming months till the begginings of the Stream Era.</p>
        <h3> The dark Era </h3>
        <p>At some point discussion started to reduce and contest were less frequent, at this time, HoneyBadger made his appearance in the server, the server was less and less active every day besides some events like the glorious beer chain by Mantvyy and the creation of the "beertender" role. (The role is for making a small but substancial donation to Zuzelo, SPLATPLAYS later gained this role in the Stream Era)</p>
        <h3> The Stream Era </h3>
       <p>Zuzelo decided to start streaming which brought a fresh air to all the community, thanks to promotion by discord members like SPLATPLAYS, Seldon, and even Zuzelo. From the streams many people started joining or became active such as GentleEgo, Prepriegrane, Andasen, SPLATPLAYS, Marshtoast and others, this growth also gave birth to another server, THE CAUSE, where active users were invited to discuss and plan things without Zuzelo. (See THE CAUSE) 
(THE CAUSE was brought about by community members anger towards Zuzelo harming Children that he clearly knows don't have what he wants)
The server was more active than ever with fun interaction and games between Zuzelo and the community primarily on streams and less so on the discord server, much more fanart was created, and a new channel for programming discussion was created. 
There were also much more fun events such as The Cause Uprising, the GNTH stream series or Seldon's and MarshToasts wedding (??? Wrong place for this).</p>
        <h3> The Stagnant Era </h3>
        <p>As the novelty of streams began to fade and Zuzelo began to have some difficulty with his editing style the activity came down, while maintaining some more discussion then The Dark Era and The Golden Trio Era. </p>
        <h3> The Current Era </h3>
        <p>With the return of Zuzelo and some other member of the community some new projects begin to be put in place such as this Wiki (Developed by SPLATPLAYS and maintained by the community) or The soon to come return of streams, the server is getting more active then before and it is a good omen for the future</p>
      </div>
      <h2> Contest</h2>
      <div class = "container">
<p>Discord Contest are usually just art contest but 4 have impacted zuzelo's channel a bit more than others</p>

<p>      - An art contest was made to make the banner of the Youtube Channel </p>
      
<p>			 - A contest was made to decide the introduction of a new unit in the famous <a href="/Series/Ai_Wars" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"> Ai Wars Series </a>. That's how the <strong>Frenchman Unit</strong> got introduced in Ai Wars, as an idea proposed by discord user <strong>Lassé</strong>, one of the most active members of the discord at the time. </p>

      <p>      - Finally, two contest were made more recently to choose a idea for a new video. </p>
      
      <p>The first contest resulted in the "Ai Beats Tower Defense" video which was extremely popular; proposed by user <strong>Seldon08</strong> also one of the most active members of the discord.</p>
     
      <p>In the second contest user <strong>SPLATPLAYS </strong>, founder of the wiki, and major helper in the community, won by proposing the idea <strong>"Ai learns to conquest planets"</strong> which would then be changed with some added suggestions from other members to <strong>"Ai learns to survive in Space"</strong> which hasn't come out yet at this time!</p> 
      </div>
      <h2>Active Members of the Discord</h2>
      <p> The most wonderful users of the community in the discord server </p>
      <p><i>For your information the lvl is an indication of how much someone spoke, but due to bot unavailability and accounts getting destroyed it isn't always accurate of how active someone is</i></p>
      <div class = "container">
        <h3><a href="/Zuzelo" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Zuzelo</a></h3>
        <p> Zuzelo is the founder of the discord server and owner of the Zuzeloapps Account, he is also the one with the most lvl (55). He isn't the most active but is obviously at the core of the community making streams, contests, and content for all members to enjoy!</p>
        <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/Seldon" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Seldon</a></h3>
        <p> Seldon is actually one of the most active members of the discord server with 48 levels. He was part of the Golden Trio and arrived with the wave of "From Ze Start" members. He stayed active since he arrived and is one of the most knowledgable about the community and the discord notably founding "THE CAUSE" server, getting married with MarshToast and participating a lot in this wiki(Seldon in fact made this page and is writing this). He is famously French and enjoys programming and reading a lot.
          <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/prootzel"style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" >Prootzel</a></h3>
        <p> Prootzel was here almost from the beginning of the server and has been active in the beginning and structure era climbing to lvl 35, he's still around and sometimes talks or helps others. Being interested in coding, he's notably active in the programming channel since it's creation. He's one of the most ancient active members!
        </p>
       <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/Radnugget"style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" >Radnugget</a></h3>
        <p> Like Prootzel, Radnugget was here since the first Eras, talking much more then Prootzel currently. He's the first and only "moderator" (even if SPLATPLAYS also counts as a moderator he is defined as "helper" and not "moderator") of the server. Being American allowed him to manage chat when zuzelo was away due to different timezones. He's still active from time to time and knows a lot of things about this community. He's also talking much more in the programming channel since he is a godot fanatic!</p>
        <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/Lasse"style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" >Lassé</a></h3>
        <p> Lassé is one of the OG active members and one of the core members of this community, here since The Beginning Era and shining most through The Golden Trio Era, going to level 28 then getting his account deleted. He however came back with a new account with which he got back up to level 20. He comes back from time to time to discuss and chill with other members, he has a few accomplisments like winning the Ai_Unit contest idea and implementing 4 emojis for the discord, he is also part of "THE CAUSE"!</p>
        <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/Badger" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Badger</a></h3>
        <p> Badger is one of the most mysterious and particular individuals on the discord server. He came during The Dark Era 28 and has himself multiple eras such as <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. Even while being one of the most <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> members he improved and remained one of the core member of the community, notably by <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, or by making some drawing then by joining 'THE CAUSE'. He mostly talks during unactive times and has sometimes had crises of <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. He truly is one of the great mysterys of Zuzelo's community. He once got banned for going too far in his acts but managed to be forgiven by <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>! He still remains active, being calmer than at the beginning but still sometimes <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>.
        <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/MarshToast" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">MarshToast</a></h3>
        <p> MarshToast is a very active member of the community, making his appearance in The Dark Era and getting active when Zuzelo started streaming. He has since been one of the most active in the community going to lvl 28 in a few months. He also made various fan art and drawings of Pogo, Greg, Chilkz, and of some members of the community! He participated a lot of the community, being part of "THE CAUSE" and having a wedding with Seldon. He is one of the greatest artist of the community and a time to time coder!</p>
        <h3> <a href="/Community/Discord/SPLATPLAYS" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">SPLATPLAYS</a></h3>
					<p> SPLATPLAYS is a major member of the community, becoming active at the beginning of the stream era he rapidly climbed up to level 25. However his lvl is only representative of a part of all of his influence in the community. For starters SPLATPLAYS is the only one to my knowledge to get 2 special roles since he is both a Beertender (The Second of 2) and the first and only helper in Zuzelo's server. SPLATPLAYS has made many projects such as this wiki, Penguin's Dungeon personal Bot, Ultrapogo and much more. He is also the most active twitch user and one of the most if not the most active stream user. He helps organize many things in the community and is of a great help. As his bio says he is a passionate developer making games in collaboration with HomelessBob, another user. This game was playtested on stream and is still on developement.
To conlude, it is clear that splatplays had and still has a big influence in the community, being the best helper we could've got.
