<p>The Frenchman was proposed by <strong>Lasse</strong>, an active Discord member, and voted 19 times, almost twice the average of other propositions.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting a "red" team as usual, Frenchmen fought against "humanity" because French are obviously eldritch horror-level threats.</p>
